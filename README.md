>Our team project aims to create an application for a book store.
In our application, there will be a book database storing information about **books**
and ** authors**. We have 2 tables, one is for books, the other one is for authors.
There is one-to-many relationship between authors and books: One author can write
multiple books but one book can only be written by one author.

 >In our book table, there will be 6 columns: Book number # (this is the primary key for books),
Book Name, Year, Author, Summary and Actions.

Book # | Book Name |Year |Author|Summary
------ | ----------|-----|------|-------
1|	*Pride and Prejudice*	|1813|	Jane Austen|Please refer to our web page
2|	*Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets*|1998|	J. K. Rowling	View	Edit|Please refer to our web page

>In our author table, there will be 4 columns: Author id # (this is the primary key for authors),
